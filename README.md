# Flower-Prediction-using-Unsupervised-Machine-Learning
In this model, I used Iris Dataset for prediction using Machine Learning algorithms . The algorithms which I used are KMeans Clustering and Hierachical . The Iris Dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).
